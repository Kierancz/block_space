			  Blokkspace is a new tool that allows you to build a narrative
			  from rearrangeable blocks that can contain any HTML content. 
			  You can invite friends to collaborate in the creation of the
			  space and when you're finished you can share your space with 
			  the world or keep it between you and friends.
